## 📖 Description
> The **cpp_modules** are designed to introduce students to the C++ programming language while building a strong foundation in **object-oriented programming (OOP)**.
>
> They progressively cover fundamental to advanced C++ concepts, encouraging problem-solving, abstraction, and good software design practices.

## 🛠️ Features
### 🎯 Goals
1. **Introduce C++**: Learn C++ syntax, core features, and advantages over C.
2. **Build a Strong Foundation**: Data types, control structures, functions, classes, inheritance, polymorphism, templates.
3. **Develop OOP Skills**: Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and reusability.
4. **Enhance Problem-Solving**: Solve progressively complex challenges with efficient design and implementation.
5. **Prepare for Advanced Topics**: Gain skills applicable to game development, system programming, and high-performance computing.

### 📚 Covered Concepts
- Classes & Objects
- Inheritance & Polymorphism
- Operator Overloading
- Exception Handling
- Templates & Generic Programming
- STL (Standard Template Library) basics

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hanmpark/cpp_modules
cd cpp_modules
```
Each module is self-contained in its own directory with its own `Makefile`.

## 🚀 Usage
